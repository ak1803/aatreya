        <p class="ser-txt">At first, chronic wounds are regularly cleaned and covered using wound dressings and bandages. If a wound still hasn’t healed after a long time despite this wound care, special treatments such as vacuum-assisted closure or skin grafts are used.
 If someone has a wound for more than eight weeks without any signs of it healing, it's considered to be a chronic wound. These kinds of wounds usually arise as a result of poor blood circulation, diabetes or a weak immune system. Open wounds on the lower leg are also known as venous leg ulcers. </p>
